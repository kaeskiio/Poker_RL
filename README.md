# Poker Reinforcement Learning Program

## Overview
This project is a Poker simulation and training environment developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The program leverages reinforcement learning techniques to train AI agents to play poker and improve their strategies over time, using libraries such as PyTorch and RLCard.

## Features
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Implements reinforcement learning algorithms to train AI agents in decision-making and strategy development, using PyTorch.
- **Poker Simulation:** Utilizes the RLCard toolkit to create a realistic poker environment where AI agents can learn and enhance their poker skills.
- **Performance Tracking:** Monitors and tracks the performance of AI agents, providing insights into their learning progress.
- **Customizable Training:** Allows users to adjust parameters such as learning rates, exploration strategies, and reward structures to fine-tune the AI's training process.

## Development
This Poker Reinforcement Learning program was developed using the following technologies:
- **Python**: The programming language used to implement the algorithms and simulations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for coding and visualization.
- **PyTorch**: A deep learning library used for implementing the reinforcement learning algorithms.
- **RLCard**: A toolkit specifically designed for developing reinforcement learning environments for card games.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Libraries used for numerical operations and data manipulation.

## How It Works
1. **Environment Setup:** The poker game environment is defined using RLCard, including the rules, actions, and rewards.
2. **Agent Training:** AI agents are trained using reinforcement learning techniques implemented with PyTorch.
3. **Learning Process:** The agents learn from their actions, continuously improving their strategies through iterative training.
4. **Evaluation:** The performance of the AI agents is evaluated over multiple games, and strategies are adjusted for optimal play.
